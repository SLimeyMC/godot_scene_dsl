Simple Godot scene DSL for Kotlin. Made with Gotdot Kotlin/JVM

Why not scene? I dont know, to be fair you can also add scene to the DSL and it should work fine.
# Features
Have a base function for creating new node be it from Godot or your own. Can be attached with script, children or custom propety with helper function to keep it type safe.


Currently only builder and property helper for Node, CanvasItem and Control. More to come

# How to contribute
Keep the addition for the builder and property helper as small as possible, and contribute to the PR draft. Currently I will add any Node that inherits from Control as that's
my main focus.
